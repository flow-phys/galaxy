Methods:  The initial program was written "naivly" which consisted of all force computations been done descretly 
inside of the inner-most loop.  For each body, the forces were then used to integrate forwards in time.  After profiling
this code, most of the work was being done within the inner most loop but it was evenly distibuted over several lines of code.
The next code I tried, attempted to utilize the fortran vector operations.  This sped many operations up but then seemed to
be a large bottle neck when dividing by a vector. (more so then a loop of scalars) So I hybridized the 2 methods using an inner 
loop for the division algebra ( 1/r ) and vector operations for the remainder.  For the sum, I used the BLAS routine SDOT for a dot
product rather then the fortran instrinsic "SUM" or an inner loop.  The BLAS was faster then both and decreased run time by %10
or so.  Also, I used the BLAS level 1 routine SAXPY for the temporal integration.  This also save time but only a few %.
